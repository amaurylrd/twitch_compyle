2. Poetry any stable version like 1.2.2 (requires Python 3.7 and above). <br>
https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

3. ImageMagick <br>
https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php 

:warning: Once you have installed it, ImageMagick should be automatically detected by MoviePy, except for some developpers under specific OS like:
- for **windows users**, you may also set the variable _IMAGEMAGICK_BINARY_ from the moviepy/config.py file. To avoid doing so, make sure to check _"install legacy utilities"_ in the installation wizard.
  
- for **ubuntu users (>= 19.04)**, you may have installed from [apt://imagemagick]() or via the following command lines, then you need to disable this line ``<policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@*"/>`` from the security policy file located at ``/etc/ImageMagick/policy.xml``.

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install imagemagick
```

> MoviePy additionally depends on the Python modules Numpy, imageio, Decorator, and tqdm, which will be automatically installed during MoviePyâ€™s installation but it also needs extra common libraries like PIL, FFMPEG for specific usecases...
