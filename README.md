## Requirements

1. Python, at least 3.10

2. Poetry, any stable version since 1.2 but idealy requires 1.3 or above <br>
<https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>

1. ImageMagick <br>
<https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php>

:warning: Once you have installed it, ImageMagick should be automatically detected by MoviePy, except for some developers under specific OS:

- for **windows users**, you may also set the variable _IMAGEMAGICK_BINARY_ from the moviepy config file. To avoid doing so, make sure to check _"install legacy utilities"_ in the installation wizard.

- for **ubuntu users (â‰¥ 19.04)**, you may have installed from [apt://imagemagick]() (or via the apt install command line), then you need to disable this line ``<policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@*"/>`` from the security policy file located at ``/etc/ImageMagick/policy.xml``.

> MoviePy additionally depends on the Python modules Numpy, imageio, Decorator, and tqdm, which will be automatically installed during MoviePyâ€™s installation but it also needs extra common libraries like PIL, FFMPEG for specific usecases...
